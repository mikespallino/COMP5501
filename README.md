## SuperMAM

SuperMAM is a super computing environment built from a cluster of Raspberry Pis. This repository contains code and setup
scripts for the cluster.

Code for SuperMAM is written in either C or Fortran90. SuperMAM uses TAU (Tuning and Analysis and Utilities) for the performance analysis of parallel programs. One node in the cluster, called the login node, is used to start a program. Portable Batch System / TORQUE is used to distribute the work over the rest of the clusterâ€™s compute nodes. Message passing between the login node and the compute nodes is done through OpenMPI.

All job submission scripts are located in the /submission_scripts.
All compiled binaries are included in /bin.
All source code is included in /src.

## Three Main Programs

There are three main programs included in this repository. An integral solver, a dictionary password attack, and a
basic form of bitcoin mining.
