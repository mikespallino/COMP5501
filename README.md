## SuperMAM
Authors: Matthew Smith, Michael Spallino, Andy Tse


SuperMAM is a super computing environment built from a cluster of Raspberry Pis. This repository contains code and 
setup scripts for the cluster.


Code for SuperMAM is written in either C or Fortran90. SuperMAM uses TAU (Tuning and Analysis and Utilities) for the
performance analysis of parallel programs. One node in the cluster, called the login node, is used to start a program.
Portable Batch System / TORQUE is used to distribute the work over the rest of the clusterâ€™s compute nodes. Message
passing between the login node and the compute nodes is done through OpenMPI.


All job submission scripts are located in the /submission_scripts.


All source code is included in /src.

## Three Main Programs

There are three main programs included in this repository. An integral solver, a dictionary password attack, and a
basic form of bitcoin mining.

## Compiling and Running
Standard compilation
```
gcc      prog.c   -o prog
gfortran prog.f90 -o prog
```

If MPI calls are used
```
mpicc  prog.c   -o prog
mpif90 prof.f90 -o prog
```

If TAU is being used for profiling
```
tau_cc.sh     prog.c   -o prog
tau_mpif90.sh prog.f90 -o prog
```

Pi Miner
```
mpicc pi_miner.c -o pi_miner -lssl -lcrypto
```
